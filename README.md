# Introduction to Programming

Congratulations on starting your journey of learning how to program!

The curriculum here will take you from knowing nothing about programming to being able to express yourself clearly in code, albeit at a basic level.

We'll move from simple iteration exercises to (eventually) building out full-fledged applications in Ruby on Rails.

It's worth remembering that learning how to program effectively is more about learning a different way of thinking than learning a bunch of syntax.

With that in mind: really dig into the logic of each exercise. Get the syntax right, but, more importantly, make sure you're expressing your logic clearly.

Nobody becomes a master at this stuff overnight.

### Structure

First, you'll want to check out the [Getting Started](readings/getting_started.md) section to make sure you have the necessary tools installed on your computer.

Each lesson covers a section of the Ruby universe. It's not an exhaustive list, but it's enough to get you rolling.

There's a group of readings to do before you dive into the exercises for each section. **Do the readings.** Nothing will make any sense otherwise.

### Helpful tips

* **Keep your code organized.** A huge part of that is fanatically adhering to a style guideline. [AirBnB's](https://github.com/airbnb/ruby) style guide is pretty great. Don't worry if you haven't seen everything yet, but refer back to a style guide frequently to keep your code neat.
* **Write in pseudocode, then translate it into real code.** Get your logic down, then work on making it computer friendly. Use the `#` character at the beginning of a line to comment it out (so it won't affect your program's execution).
* **Early on, print debugging is your friend.** Until you master more advanced debugging features in Ruby, simply printing out your variables can go a long way towards illuminating how your program functions. It won't look pretty, but it's pretty effective.
* **Someone has solved a similar problem before.** Asking around on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) or some heavy Googling will usually get you closer to an answer. Don't be afraid to corner a more experienced Rubyist and ask them to look over your code.
* **When in doubt, read the documentation.** Confused about what a method does? Read [the source](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/). Look up whatever method is confusing you and you'll find very explicit instructions for how to the method works, how to invoke it, and what it returns.
