# Function Exercises

### Open for Business

Write a method that takes two arguments: one for the opening hour of a business and another for its closing hour (both in military time).

Your method should return how many hours per day that business is open.

### Object Profiler

A lot of times in Ruby, we'll want to know what type of object we're dealing with.

Write a method called `object_profiler` that takes any input, prints the class of that object, then returns what type of object it is.

Hint: you might want to use the `.class` method.

### Available Methods

It's very useful to know what methods are available to a certain object. We're going to write a tool that helps us out with that.

Using your `object_profiler` method from the above exercise, write a method that takes an input and lists the methods that can be called on that input.

Hint: you will almost certainly want to use the `.methods` method.
