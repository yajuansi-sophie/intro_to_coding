# Getting Started

If you are using a Mac, you're in luck. If you're on Windows, programming in Ruby will be a little more difficult.

Either way, head over to [Install Rails](http://installrails.com/) and follow the instructions for your system there. Everything you need for the entirety of this course should be installed after following their instructions.

It goes without saying that if you are on an outdated version of your software, things might not work correctly. Update your software.

Feel free to reach out if you have any trouble with the installation process (although I can't say I've ever installed an environment on a Windows computer): michael@unroll.me.

Finally, please head over to Codecademy and complete the first section, [Introduction to Ruby](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/ruby-beginner-en-d1Ylq/0/1).

Congratulations on beginning your programming journey!
